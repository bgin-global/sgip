# BGIN IAM, Key Management & Privacy Working Group DRAFT Charter

## 1) Working Group name:
IAM, Key Management and Privacy Working Group (IPWG)

## 2) Purpose
The goal of IPWG is:
* to explore possible approaches on digital identity and access management using blockchain/DLT for online resource access.
* to examine identity (including keys) and access management in relation to blockchain based financial services such as crypto assets exchanges/custodians
* to give considerations on reconcile conflicting needs between privacy preserving and traceability for regulatory enforcement
* to fill the gap of knowledge on technologies and foster common understanding on the issues among stakeholders.

## 3) Scope
### In Scope
* The work will include centralized and fully decentralized systems, permmissioned and permissionless systems, and public and private/consortium networks.
* The work will include both private and public sector initiatives and use-cases.
* The group will examine both existing/developing privacy enhancing technologies for DeFi and regulatory requirements and their enforcement.

### Out of scope:
IDM and Credential Management that does not involve BC or DLT.

## 4) Proposed Deliverables
The group proposes the following Specification deliverables:
1. Discussion note on digital identity (including keys) and access management using Blockchain/DLT for Online resource access that will be a supplement to 2nd and 3rd work items;
2. Guidances and good practice documents as well as policy recommendations for centralized crypto-assets exchanges that describe identity (including keys) and access management for access to crypto-assets exchanges;
3. High-level concept note to address issues related to privacy enhancing technologies and regulatory enforcement including AML/CFT in fully decentralized permissionless financial transactions (DeFi) that gives considerations on the way for balancing privacy and traceability for the purpose of prevention of financial crimes (ML/TF);
4. A guidebook on relevant technologies for non-technical persons including public authorities that explains technologies in a plane and easy to understand manner.

## 5) Anticipated audience or users
The following stakeholders are conceived as the audience of the deliverable of this WG:

* Crypto-currency Exchanges;
* Distributed identity management developers and deployers;
* Management, architects, and implementers of IAM and claims transfer systems for blockchain/DLT access or the system that utilizes blockchain/DLT systems;
* Financial and privacy regulators and enforcement authorities.

## 6) Language
English

## 7) Method of work:
Online forums and issue tracking system with regular Video meetings and occasional face to face meetings.

## 8) The basis for determining when the work is completed:
The work will be completed once it is apparent that maximal consensus on the draft has been achieved, consistent with the purpose and scope. Where applicable, it shall have more than three running code that is interoperable.

# Background information
Although it is not clearly devidable, in the current blockchain based financial system, there are conceptually two different types of systems depending on the underlying technologies; centralized systems and decentralized permissionless systems. Both of them have been facing difficulties including handling identity, privacy and regulatory compliance, and key management issues. This working group will develop documents with the aim at addressing and mitigating these difficulties.  

1. Key Managemnt

Importance of key management cannot be overstaed. There are several reasons for it. e.g., 

* Consumer protection from lost and stolen signature key especially at custody and exchange 
* AML/KYC from the point of view of the regulators. 

These issues needs to be discussed. 

2. Privacy and traceability issues for fully decentralized permissionless financial system (DeFi)

Fully decentralized permissionless financial system is still just an imaginary creature at this moment. However, no one can predict what will happen in mid-to-long term especially because of the rapid development of relevant technologies and enthuasism in blockchain community.

In recent years, many privacy enhancing technologies for DeFi have been developed within the tech community with several aims including preserving user privacy and enhancing fungibility. Needless to say, privacy is important for users of financial services; however, at the same time, privacy could make it harder for enforcement authorities to find out and catch financial criminals. In recent yeasr, in particular after the publication of Libra proposal with the plan for transition to permmissionless system, regulatory authorities and AML/CFT authorities have more and more become keen on the implecation of decentralized permissionless system for financial regulations.

Sooner or later, DeFi needs to find the "clever" solution(s) to resolve these two (seemingly) conflicting needs; privacy enhancement and preventing financial crimes. At this moment, tech community and regulatory community making hard efforts in pursuing their own purposes without much communication and cooperation. This working group, first, provides place for different stakeholders to get together to learn each other and explore solution(s) for this difficult challenge.
